# Simple Linear Regression Model
This is just a simple model to refresh my memory. I only used a chatbot to product the csv file to save time. Then I used squarefeet of a house as features and the price as its target.

## Steps to run
1. Enter github codespaces

2. Copy paste the two following commands one by one into the terminal
```sh
cd LinearRegression
```
```sh
python LinearRegression.py
```
You'll see the predicted value of a house with 1000 square feet along with the models MSE(mean squared error) and RMSE(root mse) results
